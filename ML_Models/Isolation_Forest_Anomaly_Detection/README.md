# 🌲 Isolation Forest Algorithm – README

## 📖 About Isolation Forest

The **Isolation Forest (iForest)** is an **unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm**. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on profiling "normal" data points, iForest directly **isolates anomalies**.

The intuition is:

* Anomalies are **few and different**.
* Since they are different, they are easier to **isolate** with fewer random splits.
* The algorithm builds multiple random trees and observes how quickly a point is isolated.

👉 This makes iForest **fast, scalable, and effective** for high-dimensional datasets.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Random Partitioning** – The algorithm randomly selects a feature and a split value between its min and max range.
2. **Tree Construction** – A data point is recursively split until it is isolated (i.e., no further splits are possible).
3. **Path Length Measurement** – The number of splits required to isolate a point is its **path length**.

   * Anomalies → shorter paths (few splits).
   * Normal points → longer paths (many splits).
4. **Scoring** – The anomaly score is computed based on the average path length across multiple trees.

## 🧮 Mathematical Intuition

Let’s define the path length of a point **x** as **h(x)**.

* The **average path length** of unsuccessful searches in a Binary Search Tree (BST) with `n` samples is:

h(n) ≈ 2H(n-1) - (2(n-1)/n)

Where:

* H(i) = harmonic number ≈ ln(i) + 0.5772156649 (Euler’s constant γ).

The **anomaly score** `s(x, n)` is defined as:

s(x, n) = 2^(- E\[h(x)] / c(n))

Where:

* E\[h(x)] = average path length of point x over many trees
* c(n) = average path length of unsuccessful BST searches with n points

👉 Interpretation:

* s(x, n) → close to 1 → strong anomaly
* s(x, n) → around 0.5 → normal point
* s(x, n) → close to 0 → highly regular

## ✅ Advantages

* ⚡ **Efficiency** – Works well with high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.
* 🔍 **No Distribution Assumption** – Does not assume any specific statistical distribution.
* 🌐 **Scalable** – Linear time complexity with small memory requirements.
* 🏗️ **Simple Concept** – Easy to understand and interpret compared to probabilistic models.

## ⚠️ Limitations

* 📉 **Randomness Sensitivity** – Results may vary depending on the randomness of splits.
* 🔎 **Not Deterministic** – Different runs may produce slightly different outcomes.
* ⚡ **Works Best with Clear Anomalies** – Subtle anomalies may be harder to detect.
* 📊 **Less Effective for Very Small Datasets** – Needs sufficient data to build reliable trees.

## 🌟 Summary

Isolation Forest is a **powerful anomaly detection technique** that isolates data points instead of profiling them. By leveraging **random partitioning and path length analysis**, it is highly effective in detecting outliers across diverse domains.
